Power BI Take Home Project
1. Imported Data from Excel:
Opened Power BI Desktop and used “Get Data” > “Excel” to import the required datasets.
Selected relevant sheets and loaded them into the data model.
2. Data Transformation:
Opened Power Query Editor.
Reviewed and changed data types (e.g.,Number to date) to ensure each column was in the correct format for analysis.
3. Data Modeling:
Created relationships between the three tables using the Customer ID column as the key.
Set the cross filter direction to “Both” for all relationships so filters can flow between all connected tables.
Verified relationship integrity and ensured there were no circular dependencies or inactive relationships.
4. Created Measures:
Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to build calculated measures (e.g., Total Portfolio, Total Transactions, Average ROI).
Ensured measures were dynamic and responded correctly to filters and slicers.
5. Data Analysis & Visualization:
Analyzed trends and insights from the data using filters and slicers.
Built visualizations like Column chart, Line graph, tables, and KPIs based on analysis results.
Arranged visuals in a clean, logical dashboard layout for end-user understanding and applied background color as per Fidelity requirement
